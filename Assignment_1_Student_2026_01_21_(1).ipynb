        "# EE 467 Homework 1: Twitter Spam Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first homework of EE 467! Here we will apply the ML pipline introduced in the second lab to **Twitter spam message detection problems**. In the past few years, social medias like Twitter has become the target of spam posting. Automatic spam posts can not only affect user experience, but they can also spread misinformation and subtly affect public opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework, we will work on a mini Twitter message dataset extracted from the CRESCI-2017 dataset. This dataset contains 50000 Twitter messages, half of which are sent by real Twitter users and half of which generated by spam bots. Your task is to train classifiers that can tell these two kinds of messages apart. This time, you'll go deeper and try multiple feature extractors and classifiers. Like the labs, you will need to fill out blanks in code cells. You are also going to answer a few questions and **optionally** work on improvements to existing pipeline completely on your own.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Before You Start\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You can discuss on Slack if you have questions and want to seek help; however, please try your best to **limit the scope of your question** and **avoid asking directly for answers**. You should also **avoid copy-pasting answers and code** from others.\n",
        "2. You **may use AI assistants** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to support your work. If you do, you must **clearly acknowledge** this by stating:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The name of the AI assistant**, and  \n",
        "- **How it was used** (e.g., brainstorming, clarifying concepts, debugging, editing, generating examples)\n",
        "\n",
        "You **must not copy and paste** AI-generated content directly into your submission without **fully understanding** what it does and being able to **explain it in your own words**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. You can **optionally work on this homework with one other student of this course as a team**, but **each of you needs to submit the homework individually**. If you choose to form a group, please include the name of your teammate here: _(Name of your teammate)_.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "We will begin our ML pipeline with feature extraction in this homework, as the dataset is good enough and does not need any special pre-processing. As usual, we will load the dataset into memory, extract samples features into vectors and split the dataset into training and test sets."

This time, we will also try `TfidfVectorizer` and see which feature extractor performs better. Here we will introduce the algorithm it implemented, **TF-IDF**:\n",

On the other hand, unique yet frequent (in any $d \\in D_t$) words will get higher weight. Research has shown that TF-IDF is easy to implement and performs relatively well.\n",

Instead, we will generate **character N-grams** from these messages.\n",
